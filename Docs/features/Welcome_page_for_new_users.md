Landing page if user is new (based on cookies or other simplest solution)

Ask the user if he wants to reed the Guide or proceed to using the app.
option 1 read the guide
option 2 proceed to using the app
option 3 proceed to using the app and do not show anymore (save in cookie or same place where we know is the user is new or not)


Guide should explain the purpose of the app and how to use it (main features).
It also needs to be "for dummies".
